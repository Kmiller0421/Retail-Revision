# Retail-Revision
A revision of Retail Merchandising Services employee portal.

# Purpose - :black_nib:
I noticed the employee portal at my job was only written with HTML and CSS. So, I decided to practice my HTML and CSS skills by recreating
the employee portal but with a modernized look.

# Tools - :wrench:
* HTML
* CSS

# Demo Screenshots - :camera:
