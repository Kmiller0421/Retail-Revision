# Retail-Revision
A revision of Retail Merchandising Services employee portal. User will be able to login and see the main dashboard.

# Purpose - :black_nib:
I noticed the employee portal at my job was only written with HTML and CSS. So, I decided to practice my HTML and CSS skills by recreating
the employee portal but with a modernized look.

# Tools - :wrench:
* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* MySQL

# Demo video - :movie_camera:
Coming Soon!!!
